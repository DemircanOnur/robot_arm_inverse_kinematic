# robot_arm_inverse_kinematic

This project created by Onur Demircan at Selcuk University as a school project.
Project includes 5-axis robot arm. 
URDF represents visual and collision of robot arms's joint and link.
5_axis_robot_arm.cpp provide robot inverse kinematics as for that user's input point x,y,z.
